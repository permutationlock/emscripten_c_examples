# Cross-compiling C with Emscripten

A collection of examples using [clang][5] and [Emscripten][6] to
build C projects targeting the web. Examples were pulled from an
[article I wrote][9].

## Dependencies

You will need [clang][5], [Emscripten][6], and [lld][10] to build
and link the projects. The web server for testing the projects uses
[Go][7]. [Make][3] is used for build scripts.
